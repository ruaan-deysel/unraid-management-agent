## [2025.11.11] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **VM CPU Percentage Tracking**: Implemented proper CPU percentage calculation for VMs
  - Added historical tracking to VM collector using `cpuStats` struct with mutex protection
  - Guest CPU % now calculated from `virsh domstats` CPU time deltas over time intervals
  - Host CPU % now calculated from QEMU process CPU usage via `/proc/[pid]/stat`
  - CPU percentages are calculated as: `(current_time - previous_time) / time_interval / num_vcpus * 100`
  - Percentages are clamped to valid range [0, 100] to handle edge cases
  - CPU stats history is automatically cleared when VMs are shut off
  - First measurement after VM start returns 0% (requires two measurements for delta calculation)
  - Subsequent measurements return accurate real-time CPU percentages
  - Host CPU % matches the percentage shown in `ps`/`top` for the QEMU process
  - Guest CPU % represents the percentage of allocated vCPUs being used inside the guest OS

### Changed

- **VM Collector**: Enhanced with CPU tracking infrastructure
  - Added `cpuStats` struct to store guest CPU time, host CPU time, and timestamp
  - Added `previousStats` map with mutex for thread-safe historical tracking
  - Added `getGuestCPUTime()` method using `virsh domstats --cpu-total`
  - Added `getHostCPUTime()` method reading `/proc/[pid]/stat`
  - Added `getQEMUProcessPID()` method using `pgrep` to find QEMU process
  - Added `clearCPUStats()` method to reset tracking when VMs are shut off
  - Updated `getVMCPUUsage()` to accept `numVCPUs` parameter and calculate real percentages

### Removed

- **Placeholder CPU Values**: Removed the "needs historical data" limitation
  - CPU percentage fields now return real values instead of always returning 0
  - Removed placeholder comments about needing historical data implementation

---

## [2025.11.10] - 2025-11-08

### Added

- **Enhanced VM Statistics**: Added comprehensive VM monitoring metrics
  - Guest CPU usage percentage (placeholder for future implementation with historical data)
  - Host CPU usage percentage (placeholder for future implementation with historical data)
  - Memory display in human-readable format (e.g., "1.17 GB / 4.00 GB")
  - Disk I/O statistics: total read and write bytes across all VM disks
  - Network I/O statistics: total RX and TX bytes across all VM network interfaces
  - New DTO fields: `guest_cpu_percent`, `host_cpu_percent`, `memory_display`, `disk_read_bytes`, `disk_write_bytes`, `network_rx_bytes`, `network_tx_bytes`

---

## [2025.11.9] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **VM Collector**: Fixed parsing of VM names containing spaces
  - Changed from parsing `virsh list --all` column-based output to using `virsh list --all --name`
  - Added `getVMState()` helper method to get VM state using `virsh domstate <name>`
  - Added `getVMID()` helper method to get VM ID using `virsh domid <name>`
  - Now correctly handles VM names with spaces, hyphens, underscores, and special characters
  - Example: "Windows Server 2016" is now correctly parsed instead of being split into "Windows" and "Server 2016 running"

- **VM Control API**: Fixed VM control endpoints to work with VM names containing spaces
  - Updated VM name validation regex to allow spaces: `^[a-zA-Z0-9 _.-]{1,253}$`

  - VM control endpoints now correctly accept URL-encoded spaces (e.g., `Windows%20Server%202016`)
  - All VM operations (start, stop, restart, pause, resume, hibernate, force-stop) now work with spaces in VM names

  - Returns script metadata: name, description, path, executable status, last modified timestamp
  - Execution options: `background` (default: true), `wait` (default: false)
  - Enables automation tools like Home Assistant to remotely execute Unraid maintenance scripts

---

## [2025.11.7] - 2025-11-08

### Changed

- **README.md Simplified**: Reduced README.md to essential information only
  - Removed detailed feature lists, API endpoints, and support links
  - Kept only the plugin name heading and brief description
  - Maintains proper display name format for Plugin Manager
  - Reduces file size while preserving functionality

---

## [2025.11.6] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **Plugin Display Name**: Plugin now displays as "Unraid Management Agent" in the Unraid Plugin Manager instead of "unraid-management-agent"
  - Added README.md file to plugin directory with proper display name formatting
  - Follows Unraid plugin naming conventions used by Community Applications and other established plugins
  - Settings menu display name remains unchanged (was already correct)
  - Improves user experience and plugin discoverability in the Plugin Manager

---

## [2025.11.5] - 2025-11-08

### Added

- **USB Flash Drive Detection**: Plugin now detects USB flash drives (including the Unraid boot drive) and skips SMART data collection
  - Checks device sysfs path to identify USB transport
  - Detects Unraid boot drive by checking if device is mounted at `/boot`
  - Avoids unnecessary SMART commands on devices that don't support SMART monitoring
  - SMART status remains "UNKNOWN" for USB flash drives (consistent with previous behavior)
  - Adds debug logging to indicate when USB flash drive detection occurs

### Changed

- **NVMe-Specific SMART Collection**: Optimized SMART data collection for NVMe drives
  - NVMe drives are now detected by checking device name pattern (e.g., `nvme0n1`)
  - NVMe drives skip the `-n standby` flag since they don't support standby mode
  - Uses `smartctl -H /dev/{device}` for NVMe drives (without `-n standby`)
  - SATA/SAS drives continue to use `smartctl -n standby -H /dev/{device}` (existing behavior)
  - Adds debug logging to indicate device type detection (NVMe vs SATA/SAS)
  - Improves efficiency by avoiding unnecessary standby checks on NVMe drives

---

## [2025.11.4] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL FIX**: Disk spin-down compatibility - Plugin now respects Unraid's disk spin-down settings
  - Changed SMART data collection to use `smartctl -n standby` flag
  - Disks in standby mode are no longer woken up for SMART health checks
  - Previous implementation was preventing disks from spinning down by accessing them every 30 seconds
  - SMART status is now only collected when disks are already active
  - Preserves power savings and reduces disk wear for users with spin-down configured
  - Fixes critical issue where plugin prevented Unraid's disk spin-down functionality from working

---

## [2025.11.3] - 2025-11-08

### Changed

- Improved plugin UI/UX in Unraid interface
  - Added clickable settings link to plugin icon
  - Updated settings page title to "Unraid Management Agent"
  - Added server icon to plugin listing

### Fixed

- Settings page URL now uses correct lowercase-with-hyphens format
  - Changed from `/Settings/UnraidManagementAgent` to `/Settings/unraid-management-agent`
  - Plugin icon now navigates to the correct settings page URL
- **CRITICAL FIX**: SMART health status now correctly retrieved by running `smartctl -H` directly
  - Previous implementation tried to read from Unraid's cached files which use disk names instead of device names
  - Cached files also don't include the health status line
  - Now executes `smartctl -H /dev/{device}` to get actual health status
  - Fixes issue where all disks showed `smart_status: "UNKNOWN"` (Issue #4)

---

## [2025.11.2] - 2025-11-07

### Added

- Automated CI/CD workflow for releases using GitHub Actions
  - Automatically builds release package when Git tag is pushed
  - Calculates MD5 checksum and includes in release notes
  - Creates GitHub release with .tgz file attached
  - Extracts release notes from CHANGELOG.md
  - Supports pre-release detection (alpha, beta, rc versions)

### Fixed

- SMART health status now correctly reported in `/api/v1/disks` endpoint (#4)
  - Parses actual SMART health status from Unraid's cached smartctl output
  - Returns "PASSED" for healthy disks (SATA/SAS drives)
  - Returns "PASSED" for healthy NVMe drives (normalizes "OK" to "PASSED")
  - Returns actual status values like "FAILED" when SMART tests fail
  - No longer returns "UNKNOWN" for all disks when SMART data is available

---

## [2025.11.1] - 2025-11-07

### Added

  - Automatically detects Docker vDisk at `/var/lib/docker` mount point
  - Reports size, used, free bytes, and usage percentage
  - Identifies vDisk file path (e.g., `/mnt/user/system/docker/docker.vdisk`)
  - Includes filesystem type detection
  - Assigned role `docker_vdisk` for easy filtering
  - Enables monitoring of Docker storage capacity for alerts

  - Reports size, used, free bytes, and usage percentage
  - Identifies device name (e.g., `tmpfs` for RAM-based log storage)
  - Includes filesystem type detection (tmpfs, ext4, xfs, etc.)
  - Assigned role `log` for easy filtering
  - Enables monitoring of log storage capacity to prevent system failures
  - Critical for tmpfs-based log filesystems that can fill up and cause issues

### Fixed
