### Performance

- **Docker SDK Collector (NEW)** - Massive performance improvement:
  - Replaced CLI-based Docker collector with Docker SDK (socket API)
  - Uses `/var/run/docker.sock` directly instead of spawning `docker` processes
  - **~530x faster**: Container list from 5.8s → 10-15ms
  - **Total docker collection: 15-43ms** (was 8.8 seconds!)
  - Eliminates process spawning overhead on resource-constrained systems
  - Still reads memory stats from cgroup v2 filesystem for optimal performance

- **VM Libvirt Collector (NEW)** - Native libvirt API integration:
  - Replaced CLI-based VM collector with libvirt Go bindings
  - Uses direct RPC to libvirt daemon instead of `virsh` commands
  - **~100-200x faster**: VM list from 1-2s → 6-7ms
  - Collects CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network I/O stats efficiently
  - Graceful fallback if libvirt is not available

- **Docker Collector Optimizations** (Community feedback: HP N40L performance issue):
  - **Batched docker inspect calls**: Reduced from N separate calls to 1 batched call (3.5x faster)
  - **Skip inspect for stopped containers**: Only running containers get detailed inspection
  - Overall docker collection cycle reduced from ~8.8s to ~5.9s on test server
  - Significantly reduces CPU spikes on older hardware

  - Fixed `upsc` command to properly use `@localhost` suffix
  - UPS endpoint (`/api/v1/ups`) now correctly falls back to NUT when apcupsd unavailable
  - Both `/api/v1/ups` (basic) and `/api/v1/nut` (detailed) work simultaneously

- **Collectors Status API Endpoint** (`GET /api/v1/collectors/status`):

  - New endpoint to view status of all 14 collectors
  - Shows enabled/disabled state for each collector
  - Shows configured interval (in seconds) for each collector
  - Shows running status ("running" or "disabled")
  - Provides summary counts: total, enabled_count, disabled_count
  - Useful for monitoring and debugging collector configuration

- **Disable Collectors Feature**:

  - Added "Disabled" option to all collection interval dropdowns
  - Setting interval to 0 completely stops the collector (no CPU/memory usage)
  - Useful for disabling collectors for hardware you don't have (GPU, UPS, ZFS)
  - Disabled collectors shown with red border highlight in UI
  - Backend logs which collectors are disabled at startup

- **Environment Variable to Disable Collectors** (`UNRAID_DISABLE_COLLECTORS`):

  - New environment variable for disabling collectors without UI
  - Comma-separated list of collector names (e.g., `UNRAID_DISABLE_COLLECTORS='gpu,ups,zfs'`)
  - Validates collector names and warns about unknown names
  - System collector cannot be disabled (always required)
  - Ideal for Docker deployments or automated setups

- **CLI Flag to Disable Collectors** (`--disable-collectors`):

  - New command-line flag for disabling collectors at startup
  - Usage: `--disable-collectors=gpu,ups,zfs`
  - Same validation as environment variable
  - Both env var and CLI flag work (CLI flag populates from env var)

- **Extended Collection Intervals (up to 24 hours)**:

  - All collectors now support intervals from 5 seconds to 24 hours (86400 seconds)
  - New interval options: 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours
  - Ideal for static data that rarely changes (hardware info, registration/license)
  - Reduces power consumption significantly for infrequently-changing data

- **Web UI for Collection Intervals** (Issue #8):

  - New settings page accessible from Unraid Settings → Unraid Management Agent
  - Dropdown menus with predefined interval options (5 seconds to 30 minutes)
  - Organized into logical sections: System Monitoring, Containers & VMs, Hardware, Storage, Other
  - Human-readable labels (e.g., "30 seconds", "1 minute", "5 minutes")
  - Power consumption warning explaining impact of faster intervals
  - Automatic service restart when clicking Apply
  - No need to manually edit config files

- **Start Script**: Fixed environment variable passing to Go binary through sudo

### Fixed

- **Parity Check Status Detection (Issue #41)**:

  - Fixed parity check status not detecting "paused" state - now correctly parses `mdResyncDt` field (0 = paused, >0 = running)
  - Fixed parity check progress percentage showing 0 - now calculates from `mdResyncPos / mdResyncSize * 100`
  - Added support for detecting clearing and reconstructing operations via `sbSyncAction` field
  - Added debug logging for parity check operations to aid troubleshooting
  - Status values: `""` (idle), `"paused"`, `"running"`, `"clearing"`, `"reconstructing"`

- **Disk Temperature Reporting**:

  - Improved handling of temperature value `"*"` which indicates spun-down disk
  - Temperature 0 is now documented expected behavior for standby disks (to avoid spinning up disks for temperature checks)
  - Enhanced debug logging for temperature parsing

- **Power Consumption Optimization** (Issue #8):
  - Increased default collection intervals to reduce CPU wakeups
  - System: 5s → 15s, Array: 10s → 30s, Docker: 10s → 30s
  - VM: 10s → 30s, UPS: 10s → 60s, GPU: 10s → 60s

## [2025.11.14] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- **Enhanced GPU Monitoring and Multi-GPU Support** (Issue #8 - High Priority Items):
  - **GPU Identification Fields**: Added `Index`, `PCIID`, `Vendor`, and `UUID` fields to GPUMetrics DTO
    - `Index`: GPU index for multi-GPU systems (0-based)
    - `PCIID`: PCI bus ID (e.g., "0000:01:00.0")
    - `Vendor`: GPU vendor ("nvidia", "intel", "amd")
    - `UUID`: Device UUID (NVIDIA only)
  - **Fan Speed Monitoring**:
    - NVIDIA: `FanSpeed` field (percentage, 0-100)
    - AMD: `FanRPM` and `FanMaxRPM` fields (discrete GPUs only)
  - **AMD GPU Detection Improvements**:
    - Switched from `rocm-smi` to `radeontop` for broader AMD GPU compatibility
    - Now supports consumer Radeon GPUs (RX 5000/6000/7000 series)
    - Fallback to `rocm-smi` for datacenter GPUs (Instinct series)
    - AMD GPU temperature and fan speed read from sysfs
  - **Multiple Intel GPU Detection**:
    - Fixed bug where only first Intel GPU was detected
    - Now detects all Intel GPUs (iGPU + discrete Arc GPUs)
    - Each Intel GPU gets unique index and PCI ID
  - **NVIDIA Enhancements**:
    - Added UUID field for unique GPU identification
    - Added fan speed monitoring (percentage)
    - Added PCI bus ID extraction

### Changed

- **GPU Collector**: Complete refactor to support multi-GPU systems
  - Intel GPU collector now detects ALL Intel GPUs (removed `break` statement)
  - AMD GPU collector uses `radeontop` by default, `rocm-smi` as fallback
  - NVIDIA GPU collector queries additional fields (UUID, PCI ID, fan speed)
  - All GPU collectors now populate vendor, index, and PCI ID fields
- **GPU API Response**: Already returns array of GPUMetrics (no breaking change)
- **GPU Detection Order**: Intel → NVIDIA → AMD (unchanged)

### Technical Details

- **Intel Multi-GPU**: Collects metrics for each detected Intel GPU separately
  - Note: `intel_gpu_top` limitation - reports only first GPU's metrics
  - Multiple GPUs detected via lspci, but metrics may be from primary GPU
- **AMD radeontop**: Parses dump mode output for GPU/VRAM utilization
  - Temperature read from `/sys/class/drm/card*/device/hwmon/hwmon*/temp1_input`
  - Fan speed read from `/sys/class/drm/card*/device/hwmon/hwmon*/fan1_input`
  - Fan max RPM read from `/sys/class/drm/card*/device/hwmon/hwmon*/fan1_max`
- **NVIDIA nvidia-smi**: Extended query to include `pci.bus_id`, `uuid`, `fan.speed`
- **Driver Versions**: Extracted from `modinfo` (Intel/AMD) or `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA)

### Compatibility

- **Backward Compatible**: All new fields use `omitempty` JSON tags
- **AMD GPU Requirements**:
  - Consumer GPUs: Requires `radeontop` (install via Nerd Tools or manual)
  - Datacenter GPUs: Requires `rocm-smi` (ROCm packages)
- **Intel GPU Requirements**: `intel_gpu_top` from `igt-gpu-tools` (Unraid 6.12+)
- **NVIDIA GPU Requirements**: `nvidia-smi` (included with NVIDIA driver)

### Known Limitations

- **Intel Multi-GPU**: `intel_gpu_top` doesn't support per-device metrics
  - Multiple Intel GPUs detected, but metrics may be from primary GPU only
  - This is a limitation of `intel_gpu_top` tool, not the agent
- **AMD Fan Speed**: Only available on discrete GPUs with fan sensors
  - Integrated AMD GPUs (APUs) don't have fan sensors
- **AMD radeontop**: May require manual installation on some systems

---

## [2025.11.4] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL FIX**: Disk spin-down compatibility - Plugin now respects Unraid's disk spin-down settings
  - Changed SMART data collection to use `smartctl -n standby` flag
  - Disks in standby mode are no longer woken up for SMART health checks
  - Previous implementation was preventing disks from spinning down by accessing them every 30 seconds

  - Cached files also don't include the health status line
  - Now executes `smartctl -H /dev/{device}` to get actual health status
  - Fixes issue where all disks showed `smart_status: "UNKNOWN"` (Issue #4)

---
